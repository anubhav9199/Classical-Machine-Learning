# [Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/anubhavsharma430/Classical-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Regression/Linear%20Regression/Simple%20Linear%20Regression)
Linear Regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis algorithm. It is use in various models to the train the model to predict different things. Here, The model made is a simple linear regression model and it is fit over user **Geneated Data data**.<br>
Consider the model function.<br>
* ```
            yi = α + (β * xi)
			```
which describes a line with slope β and y-intercept α. In general such a relationship may not hold exactly for the largely unobserved population of values of the independent and dependent variables; we call the unobserved deviations from the above equation the errors. Suppose we observe n data pairs and call them {(xi, yi), i = 1, ..., n}. We can describe the underlying relationship between yi and xi involving this error term εi by<br>
* ```2
            yi = α + (β * xi) + εi
            ```
This relationship between the true (but unobserved) underlying parameters α and β and the data points is called a linear regression model.<br>

# The Code
## Scratch Code
The code is written in moduler way putting the vision of code resuability. here you get the function of Square Error, Gradients to calculate the value for the gradient of the gradient descent and the square error to minimize in the data while fitting. Actually what happening over here is that the **Model(Algorithm)** is fitting over data by minimizing th square error loss.

## Library use Code
The code is written using the Sci-Kit Learn Library. This library is use for the calling the **Machine Learning Model Class**. this classes made an object for the fitting of model over data. the model also has a predict function to predict on a given point.<br>
