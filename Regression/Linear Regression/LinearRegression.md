# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis algorithm. It is use in various models to the train the model to predict different things. Here, The model made is a simple linear regression model and it is fit over user create data.<br>
Linear regression is a algorithm which is starting level algorithm for machine learning prediction. This code contains only about how we can fit a linear model over user given dataset and also to get a good output result out of it. The code is fully library base so that to keep in mind about the use of the functions of library in other programs also. It also demponstrate all the graph that how a polynomial regression works. The Differnce between Simple, Multiple and Polynomial Linear Regression is: :-<br>
### Simple Linear Regression works over single Feature with single degree only.<br>
### Multiple Linear Regression works over multiple Feature with Single degree only.<br>
### Polynomial Linear Regression works over single Feature with Polynomial degree.<br>
