# Classical Machine Learning
The Repository contains all the model of which is use in the Classical Machine Learning. The Repo Contain file both version of notebook file and python script file and each file contains code in both scratch code form and Libraries use form. These file contains all code in moduler basis having a vision of the use of the functions in other projects and also for better understanding of the code.<br>
## The Notebook File
The notebook file can be use to understanding the basis model of the algorithm by using scratch file and the scripting file
## The Script File
The Script file is the direct use file which can be directly run over your device. The Script file having scratch code is fully modular and can be use a user base library for the model training or for any project. The library form coded file can also use a user base library but it do some function on its own.
